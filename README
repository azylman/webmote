This project is intended to bridge the gap between the IR remote and the web connected world.  At its core is a linux webserver using a pair of xbees to send IR commands wirelessly between transcievers and a web server.  


**********************
Webserver Description:
**********************

************************
Transciever Description:
************************

Each transciever will be based on an arduino with an xbee shield and a 60mW xbee.  Additionally they will have an IR LED and an IR phototransistor.


******
Tasks:
******

-Proof of concept 2-way xbee communication - Done
-Add IR LED and phototransistor to transciever 
-Build a simple web server to prove web control-to xbee link

***************
Modus Operandi:
***************

Pairing a Transciever (priliminary idea):
-The transciever will send out a request for an ID.
-The server will respond by issuing a message with format:
 "messageDestination=0,commandType=a,transceiverID=X"
 where X is an integer.
-The webserver will then prompt the admin next time they go on to the site to fill in the info for their transciever.
-Once the information has been submitted the server will send over the transcieverName to the transceiver.

--Thoughts - we have not figured out security - should this be done first or before...

Playing a Command:
-The server gets a request from the user to play a command and sends a message with format:
 "messageDestination=[transcieverID],commandType=p,command=[IRCODE]"

Recording a Command:
-The server gets a request from the user to record a command and sends a message with format: 
 "messageDestintation=[transceiverID],commandType=r
-The transceiver then turns on its recording light and waits for an IR signal.  
-After recording the signal the tranceiver sends a signal back to the server where it is saved.
